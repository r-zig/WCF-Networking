# WCF-Networking
Project that I wrote during 2011 using C# and WCF internals to provide infrastructure for network addresses between distributed nodes.
Used by client to discover it's own external address using both client and server processes.

This project originally published to CodePlex and I migrate it here after CodePlex shutdown.

The original nuget packages:

https://www.nuget.org/packages/NetworkingUtilities.Client/
