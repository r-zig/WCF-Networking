* Changing of address after first resolve.
* service mode that cache the results , determine changes , and response faster to other clients (than client that need to open p2p...)
Something that maybe will called Roniz.Networking.CacheClientService (client because its the client side - service because it should act as service for other clients ?)
This service will also have the option to host the Roniz.Networking.Service (if its network topology allow incoming messages)
* UI that show all services.
* Installation of the service as NT service
* Installation of the client ?
* support for OS that cannot work with P2P
